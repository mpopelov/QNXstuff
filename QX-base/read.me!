QX-base.

Simple database engine.
No support for relational data storage, not for complete databases.
The main purpose is to allow fast acces to data structured and stored in tables.
All tables have fixed-length records.
The most important requirement for database engine was its ability
to make 'INSERT' fast.


PERFORMANCE NOTES:

	1) Do not use one connection to serve many tables ( permanently changing them
	   with QBASE_CMD_SELECT) - better use separate connection for each table
	   you need to serve.
	
	2) When using filters for data retrieval take in mind following:
	
		-	The strongest condition to be met should be added to filter
			stack !!!_LAST_!!!
			
		-	blah blah blah
		
	3) Another blah blah blah
